# Questions  
  
- **Why react**
    - React is JS library
    - offers to use reusable custom components to create large UIs
- **What is component**
    - simply it's a js class/function which takes properties as input and return JSX element as output
- **JS can render react but why react**
    - Because React's DOM apply only the changes to the actual DOM
- **life cycle states**
    - render is a mandatory state
- **why redux**
    - Instead of having components states to their object, redux keep all of the states in a store. And a unit called provider makes the store available to all containers. Container fetch apps states data to render components. to update states, reducers get actions object and use them to update application state accordingly
- **Why state shouldn't be updated directly**
    - The render happens with the state change, and the state object statys same with the direct change even the property is added
- **What is DOM**
    - It's a representation of HTML documnets inside a browser as a tree of objects
- **what is CORS**
    - CORS is a mechanism which uses HTTP headers to allow a web application to request resources from another origin. Fetch API restrics the CORS in default.
- **why componentwillmount wont work**
    - [read](https://daveceddia.com/where-fetch-data-componentwillmount-vs-componentdidmount)
    - because render method will not wait to finish componentWillMount. so render will still happen whether the data fetched or not. So it's better to render an empty page and then load
- **synthetic events**
  - React wraps events which are native to browsers into a synthetic event Object and passes to React event handlers. Yet it has the same interface as the native events.
  - The speciality is that React reuses the synthetic event object for performance matters. Which nulls the object values after each use. So accessing event properties asynchronous leads to get null values.

- **why state is tend to in base class**
    - It's because the data flows only downwards in React, which means from parent to child. So, if the props will be changed in relevant children with the state change. So it should be the common parent to which the changing children.
- **why binding**
    - Otherwise the this refers to owner of the method. So if you pass the method to a child, Simply by the time it executes, the owner will be the child, not the parent. And If you want to change parent state through this, Best practise is to bind the parent object owner first and then pass it to the child, so it still updates parent state eventhough called inside the child.
